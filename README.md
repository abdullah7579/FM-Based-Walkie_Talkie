# FM-Based-Walkie_Talkie
This project demonstrates how to build simple Walkie-Talkies using FM transmitters and receivers. The setup enables two-way communication by alternating between transmission and reception.

🔧 Components Used
FM Transmitter Module, FM Receiver Module, Microphone, Speaker or Earphones, Power Supply (Battery or Adapter), Push-to-Talk Switch (for manual control), Breadboard and Jumper Wires

📡 How It Works
When one user presses the push-to-talk button, their voice is transmitted via the FM transmitter. The other device receives the signal through the FM receiver and outputs it through the speaker. Releasing the button allows the other user to transmit.

🛠️ Features
Simple and cost-effective communication system. Operates on standard FM frequency ranges. Full-duplex not supported (one transmits while the other receives)

🚀 Getting Started
Connect microphone and transmitter as per the circuit diagram. Connect speaker and receiver on the other end. Power both circuits. Use the push-to-talk switch to alternate transmission.

📎 Notes
Tune both modules to the same FM frequency for proper communication. Range depends on power and antenna quality.
